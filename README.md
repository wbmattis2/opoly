# Opoly  

Virtual board game developed by Benny Mattis to specifications provided in an undergraduate computer science course 

## How to Use  

Compile Opoly.java and Main.java into Opoly.class and Main.class, then run Main.class in a Java Virtual Machine. Follow the prompts in your command line interface, and progress through the game by pressing ENTER.  

## Object of the Game  

The game board is displayed as a series of asterisks (`*`). The player is represented by the `O`.  

The object of the game is to land on the last space of the board with as many points as possible.  

This is determined largely by the roll of the dice, which determines how many spaces the player will advance on the current turn. Players typically get 10 points each turn and advance a set number of spaces depending on the roll of the dice.  

Players get rewarded for landing on spaces evenly divisible by four (e.g., the eighth space on the game board), and players get penalized for landing on the second-to-last space on the board.
